# SwiftSynk - A Syncing Application

SwiftSynk is a file synchronization application designed to ensure that files and folders are seamlessly synced and backed up with Google Drive. This project was developed as a Semester Mini Project based on Python under the curriculum of University of Mumbai.

## Features of SwiftSynk:

1. **Automatic Synchronization**: SwiftSynk automatically syncs files and folders with Google Drive, ensuring your data is always up-to-date.
2. **Two-State Versioning**: After modifying a file, users can access the older version of the file, providing a version control-like functionality.
3. **Log Records**: The application stores records of all syncing, pausing, and deleting activities along with the time and date.
4. **File Deletion**: Users can delete files or folders directly from the application if they are no longer needed.
5. **Pause Syncing**: If there is an issue with the internet connection or for any other reason, users can pause the syncing process.
6. **User/Guide Information**: Displays the username, the number of files and folders synced, and provides a user guide to assist with the application's functionality.
